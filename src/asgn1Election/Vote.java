 * <p>Interface to specify a collection of <code>Integers</code> representing a vote.</p> 
 * 
 * <p><code>Vote</code> extends {@link java.lang.Iterable} to allow simple 
 *  traversal of the entries in the vote. The method {@link java.lang.Iterable#iterator()} 
 *  must appear in the implementing class.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Note to students: the guidance below is much stronger than would be given for a 
 * real interface. You should assume that the implementing class restricts the vote entries 
 * to the number of candidates in an election, and that this is a parameter. The class 
 * {@link asgn1Election.VoteList} must implement this interface. To assist you I have 
 * gutted the class but left many signatures in place. It is up to you to complete the 
 * task, but you should certainly not expect to see a specification for the constructor 
 * of the implementing class, as you have been given here.</p>
